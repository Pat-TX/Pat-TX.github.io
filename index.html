          <h1>About Me!</h1>
          <p>
          Hey! My name is Patrick Williams. I'm a student at the University of Texas at Arlington pursuing
          a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Truthfully, I was an electrical engineering major for the longest time, but then I
          took my first programming class, and, well... Here we are! I fell in love with software engineering, especially the algorithm 
          analysis side of things. I love learning all there is to learn through my classes and my own self study, which, up to this point,
          has primarily been front-end web development -- which brought me to develop my own website. I have aspirations to become a 
          full stack software engineer, but I also have a side-eye on AI and machine learning.
          </p>
          <p>
          I grew up in a small town in Kentucky, and that was my stomping grounds until I was 18. I graduated from Meade County High School
          and began my academic career at Purdue University in West Lafayette in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic hit, and that's where I decided
          to take a year break from school to see if that situation would die down -- but that didn't stop me from learning on my own! Eventually,
          I moved to Texas, joined a company as a Geographic Information Systems intern in mid 2021, and started my education back up again at
          Tarrant County College. 2 years later, I'm still at that company as a Business and Technology Specialist, continuing my education at
          UTA, and incredibly excited about what's over the horizon. 
          </p>
          <p>
